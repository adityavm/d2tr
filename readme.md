Dota 2 Team Rankings
===

Builds on the excellent [wolololodev/d2mt][d2mt] project, and uses jD's rankings to create a more visual representation of competitive team rankings. Future plans include graphs and charts to turn this into a complete competitive team quick-glance dashboard sort of thing.


Demo can be found at [code/d2tr][1].
